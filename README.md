# Micro Frontend
Micro-frontend designs break down a front-end application into little, semi-independent "microapps" that work together loosely. This can aid in the management of complex projects

## Setting up project
This project contains two micro frontends, The <b>Main</b> will be our container for all the micro apps, and <b>common-components-lib</b> will contain common components like Header, Footer, etc.
